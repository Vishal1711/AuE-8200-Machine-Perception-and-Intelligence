 ### Note - Detailed work of each homework is in the Readme of the respective homework folder

## Homework 1

1. Continuous-time signal and its FFT
2. Discrete signal and its FFT
3. Convolution operation on 1D signal




## Homework 2
The [nuScenes] (https://www.nuscenes.org/nuscenes) dataset is a public large-scale dataset for autonomous driving developed by the team at Motional (formerly nuTonomy). Motional is making driverless vehicles a safe, reliable, and accessible reality. This data aims to support public research into computer vision and autonomous driving.
1. Visualize Lidar point cloud data
2. Visualize Radar data
3. Visualize Radar data projection on image
4. Visualize LiDAR data projection on image

Tools that I used for this Assignment-
- NuScene develop kit
- OpenCV
- Open3D
