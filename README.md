 CU-ICAR Spring 2022
 ### Note - Detail work of each homework is in the Readme of the respective homework folder

## Homework 1

1. Continuous-time signal and its FFT
2. Discrete signal and its FFT
3. Convolution operation on 1D signal




## Homework 2
The [nuScenes] (https://www.nuscenes.org/nuscenes) dataset is a public large-scale dataset for autonomous driving developed by the team at Motional (formerly nuTonomy). Motional is making driverless vehicles a safe, reliable, and accessible reality. This data aims to support public research into computer vision and autonomous driving.
1. Visualize Lidar point cloud data
2. Visualize Radar data
3. Visualize Radar data projection on image
4. Visualize LiDAR data projection on image

Tools that I used for this Assignment-
- NuScene develop kit
- OpenCV
- Open3D

## Homework 3

Write code rather than using any direct build-in implementation from 3rd party (like Matlab, Python, or others) libraries.
1. RGB to gray, using a standard RGB-intensity conversion approach like NTSC and implement the convolution (using basic arithmetic operations only, rather than build-in conv()) of Sobel kernel.
2. Implement a function to perform histogram equalization for image, visualize histogram-equalized image and its histogram distribution.
3. Apply Hough transformation or other line detection approach to detect multiple lines in the image. Visualize the lines in the image space and in the transformed space.
