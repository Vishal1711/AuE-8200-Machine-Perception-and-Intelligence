## Homework 2

The [nuScenes] (https://www.nuscenes.org/nuscenes) dataset is a public large-scale dataset for autonomous driving developed by the team at Motional (formerly nuTonomy). Motional is making driverless vehicles a safe, reliable, and accessible reality. This data aims to support public research into computer vision and autonomous driving.
